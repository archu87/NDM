# Introduction
<p align="justify"> New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) is an enzyme that makes bacteria resistant to a broad range of beta-lactam antibiotics. These include the antibiotics of the carbapenem family, which are a mainstay for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. The gene for NDM is one member of a large gene family that encodes beta-lactamase enzymes called carbapenemases. Bacteria that produce carbapenemases are often referred to in the news media as "superbugs" because infections caused by them are difficult to treat. Such bacteria are usually susceptible only to polymyxins and tigecycline.

It was first detected in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from a Swedish patient of Indian origin in 2008. It was later detected in bacteria in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Japan.

The most common bacteria that make this enzyme are Gram-negative such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but the gene for NDM can spread from one strain of bacteria to another by horizontal gene transfer. </p>

# Aim of Project
<p align="justify"> Determine global NDM molecular epidemiology by whole-genome sequencing and analysing more than 1,000 isolates from multiple countries </p>
</a>


<a href="#Protocol">
# Protocol
<p align="justify"> Step by step process for NDM gene analysis. After identification of presence of NDM the whole genome sequencing of bacteria have been done using Illumina sequencing. </p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Quality check of raw data using FastQC tool.</li>
<li>Step 2: Run SPADES for assembly purpose.</li>
<li>Step 3: BLAST analysis to confirm the presence of targeted genes.</li>
</ul>
</a>
<p> Some scripts has been used to compelete the whole genome analysis. </p>
